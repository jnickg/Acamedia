Acamedia

========================================

Acamedia is the media manager for your academic life.

-----

Acamedia has the following capabilities:

*Collect your academic article PDFs into one consolidated library
*Store metadata for each document, for easy searching and retrieval
	*Data needed for academic citations
	*In-document data, such as academic keywords
	*User-created data, such as tagging, for personalized keywording
*Manually organize your documents into "folders"
*Store your folders inside your academic filing "cabinet."

-----

Acamedia will have the following capabilities:

*Hover tags—see metadata for your document without even opening it
*Give you an easy-to-use citation for any of your documents
*Assemble documents for use in a project
	*Batch print them
	*Generate a citation page for all documents
	*Save projects as new folders for easy retrieval
*Different file formats
	*Store your professors' syllabi and assignment documents
	*Store images, audio, or video files
*Rails app backend that interacts w/ WorldCat
	*Search new additions to the library
	*Attempt to pull information automatically (so you don't have to enter things like ISBN, journal, etc)

-----

Acamedia may someday get the following capabilities:

*Scan readable-text PDFs to automatically gather metadata
*Batch search your text-enabled PDFs
*Scan readable-text PDFs' citations pages to check if a new article references any articles in your library
